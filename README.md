# Rock Paper Scissors Game

A simple console-based Rock Paper Scissors game built with vanilla JavaScript. Play 5 rounds against the computer and see who wins!

## Game Description

This is a classic Rock Paper Scissors game where you compete against the computer over 5 rounds. The game runs in the browser console and uses prompts for user input.

## Features

- **5 Round Format**: Best of 5 rounds determines the winner
- **Random Computer Opponent**: Computer makes random choices using Math.random()
- **Score Tracking**: Keeps track of wins for both player and computer
- **Tie Handling**: Handles tie scenarios gracefully
- **Console-Based Interface**: All game interactions happen through browser console and prompts

## Game Rules

- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper
- Paper beats Rock
- Same choice results in a tie (round doesn't count toward score)

## How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser
2. Open the browser's developer console (F12 or right-click â†’ Inspect â†’ Console)
3. When prompted, enter your choice: `rock`, `paper`, or `scissors`
4. Watch the results of each round in the console
5. After 5 rounds, see who won the game!

## Technical Details

### Functions

#### `getComputerChoice()`
- Generates a random choice for the computer
- Returns: `"rock"`, `"paper"`, or `"scissors"`
- Uses Math.random() with probability distribution:
  - Rock: â‰¥ 0.66
  - Paper: 0.33 - 0.65
  - Scissors: < 0.33

#### `getHumanChoice()`
- Prompts the user for input
- Converts input to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison
- Returns: User's choice as a string

#### `playRound(humanChoice, computerChoice)`
- Determines the winner of a single round
- Updates scores for winner
- Logs the result to console

#### `playGame()`
- Main game loop
- Runs 5 rounds
- Declares the overall winner based on final scores

### Variables

- `humanScore`: Tracks player's wins (integer)
- `computerScore`: Tracks computer's wins (integer)

## Example Gameplay

```
Round 1
Your choice was rock
The computer chose scissors.
You won! rock beats scissors.

Round 2
Your choice was paper
The computer chose paper.
There was a tie.

Round 3
Your choice was scissors
The computer chose rock.
You lose! rock beats scissors.

...

Congrats, you won!

## ðŸ”„ Future Improvements

Potential enhancements for future versions:

- [ ] Add a graphical user interface (GUI)
- [ ] Implement best of X rounds (customizable)
- [ ] Add round history display
- [ ] Include animations for choices
- [ ] Add sound effects
- [ ] Store high scores in localStorage
- [ ] Add "Play Again" functionality
- [ ] Mobile responsive design
- [ ] Add difficulty levels (predictable vs random AI)

## Known Limitations

- All interaction happens through console and prompts
- No input validation (entering invalid choices may cause unexpected behavior)
- Case-sensitive without proper error handling
- No GUI for visual feedback
